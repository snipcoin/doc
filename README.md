### __Tokenomics__

$SNIP is the key to the Lenster ecosystem\.

### __Contract Address__

0x0000000000000000000000ÔºàÁõÆÂâçÊ≤°ÊúâÔºâ

### __Basic Function__

On Lens Protocol , users can use $SNIP to express their appreciation and support to reward their favourite creators which in turn encourages them to produce more exceptional content\. This form of reward not only motivates creators to continue their work but also provides them with tangible economic benefits from their fan‚Äôs support\. Such interactive mechanisms strengthen the bond between creators and their fans, collectively driving the advancement of creative endeavours\.

## __Total Supply__

100,000,000,000,000,000 tokens\.

Total of 100 trillion tokens\.

## __Distribution Method__

### __IDO 3%__

Coming Soon.

### __Liquidity 3%__

According to a valuation of $5 million USD , a 3% token pre\-sale will be conducted , funds raised from the pre\-sale and other additional funds will be added towards the liquidity pool\. The top 300 contributors in the pre\-sale will be eligible to receive a Founder NFT, which grants them dividend rights \. Dividends will be distributed on a weekly basis\.

### __Marketing 4%__

1% of the tokens will be allocated to incentivize early LP \(Liquidity Pool\) providers for a duration of two months \(2 months starting from onset of the project\)\. This allocation is designed to reward and encourage individuals who contribute liquidity to the ecosystem during its initial stages\.

0\.5% of the tokens will be allocated to incentivize early stakers for a duration of two months \(2 months starting from onset of the project\)\. This encourages users to participate in the staking mechanism and contribute to the stability and security of the protocol\.

Another 0\.5% of the tokens will be dedicated to incentivizing early adopters, including participants who refer others through invitation links, as well as collaborations with KOLs \(Key Opinion Leaders\) and other Lens ecosystem projects\. These incentives will be distributed through various activities and airdrops\.

The remaining 2% of the tokens will be unlocked on a weekly basis over a period of 52 weeks\. This ensures a gradual release of funds and allows for early engagement and participation\. The distribution of these tokens will be conducted through interactive activities and events\.

By implementing this token allocation and incentive structure, we hope to encourage active participation from early LP providers, stakers, and adopters, while ensuring a steady and controlled distribution of tokens over time\.

### __Airdrop 34%__

Airdrop: 34% of the total token supply is allocated for the airdrop program\.

Initial Distribution: 4% of the total token supply is allocated for the initial circulation\.

- 2% of tokens are allocated and can be claimed by regular users during the airdrop\. However, if they sell their tokens before holding a Lens handle, there will be a burn tax of over 90%\.
- A further 2% is allocated for Lens handle holders\. Users with an account balance below 100 MATIC will need to pay 5 MATIC to claim the airdrop\.

Official Handle Registration: After 30 days of the official handle registration, a total of 10% of the token supply will be distributed\.

- When the number of handles exceeds 1 million, an additional 10% of the token supply will be distributed\.
- When the number of handles exceeds 10 million, a further 10% of the token supply will be distributed\.

### __Staking 36%__

The top 20% of both contributors \(tippers\) and recipients \(content creators\) will be eligible for rewards\. These rewards will be settled on a weekly basis, with a total distribution period of 150 weeks\. It's important to note that transfers to the exchange and official addresses, as well as whitelisted addresses, will be deducted from the distribution\.

Additionally, there will be a flexible mining allocation of 16%\. This allocation will be reserved for early\-stage mining rewards and will be implemented prior to launch, with specific details and requirements communicated through our social media channels\.

The purpose of these reward mechanisms is to incentivize active participation, engagement, and support within the ecosystem\. By distributing rewards to both the tippers and content creators, we aim to foster a thriving community where both contributors and recipients are recognized and incentivized for their involvement\.

The gradual unlocking of rewards over a 150\-week period ensures a sustainable distribution and allows participants to benefit from their contributions over an extended timeframe\. This approach promotes longevity, stability, and fair distribution of rewards within the ecosystem\.

## __SnipTip Modules&Extension 20%__

## __Fees Distribution__

The fees collected through the contract are distributed as follows:

Team: 5% of the fees collected is allocated to the team\. This portion is typically intended to support the project's development, operations, and ongoing maintenance\.

NFT Holders: 5% of the fees collected is allocated to NFT holders\. This serves as a reward for NFT holders, incentivizing them to participate and engage with the platform\.

Burning: 5% of the fees collected is allocated to the burning mechanism\. This means that the tokens are permanently removed from circulation, reducing the total token supply\. Burning tokens can potentially increase the value and scarcity of the remaining tokens\.

Staking: 5% of the fees collected is allocated to staking\. This serves as a reward for users who participate in staking activities, providing liquidity or contributing to the security and stability of the network\.

## __Airdrop Criteria__

### __Initial distribution rules__

The initial distribution rules for the circulating supply are as follows:

After retweeting on Twitter and linking user‚Äôs Lens handles, the system will conduct an assessment on the total number of links after 20 hours\. Rewards can be claimed after 24 hours of completing the linking process\. The more people you invite, the higher the bonus reward\.

The initial distribution supply is divided into two tiers, based on an estimated valuation of $30 million \(approximately $10 per user\):

Total supply: 2 trillion tokens

Regular users: 2% of the total supply

Each user receives 500 million tokens with a total of 4,000 users

Top 1,000 Lens handle holders will receive 1 billion tokens each

After regular users claim their tokens, they will not be eligible to participate in the Lens Handle rounds\.

Additionally, for users who click on the invitation link, each user will receive a 10% token bonus \(valid for one week\)\. After 7 days, the top 100 users with the most invitation link clicks will receive an airdrop of dividend NFTs\.

For example: User A receives an initial airdrop of 1 billion $SNIP\. They invite 5 users to claim the airdrop\.

User A will then receive: 10*1\.1*1\.1*1\.1*1\.1\*1\.1= 17\.11 billion Snip tokens\.

The tokens for marketing expenses \(0\.4% of the total supply, 400 billion tokens\) will be distributed until the allocated quantity is exhausted\.

Before the start of staking, if a large number of dubious addresses are detected, the official entity reserves the right to blacklist those addresses\.
